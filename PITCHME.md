Note:
There is no right or wrong way to write commit messages and pull requests. What I am about to talk to you about is only my advice, so feel free to discard all of it. Although hopefully you'll pick up something useful.

@title[Who cares]

## Who cares?

Note:
Pull requests are the 2nd to last thing you do before finishing a ticket - the last thing is update your Jira ticket. Pull requests and commit messages are often rushed and done as an afterthought. You don't win internet points for doing them. I want you to consider them an important part of the development process, as much as maintainable, readable, efficient code.

@title[Because]

## Because ...

- Code reviewers will thank you |
- More likely for your PR to be merged! |
- Documentation for other developers |
- And yourself - what did you do yesterday |

Note:
Why? I think they are really important because ... saves people time. Helps future developers. Pay it forward - no direct benefit but benefits the team in the long run.
